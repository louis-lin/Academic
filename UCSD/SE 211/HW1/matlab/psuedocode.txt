% Initialize model
% Branch = 3
% Max strain/stress should be 0,0
% Min strain/stress should be -ey,-fy

% For all of the test strains
% Calculate the delta strain 
% If you're on (branch 1) or (branch 3)
	% If (strain is between the min and max strains)
		% Calculate the stress
	% Else
		% If you're moving to the right,
			% Go to branch 2
			% Set the min stress/strain as the current point
		% If you're moving to the left
			% Go to branch 4

% If you're on (branch 2 and moving to the right) or (branch 4 and moving to the left)
	% Calculate the stress
% Else
	% If you're on (branch 4) and (moving to the right)
		% Go to branch 1
		% Set the min strain/stresses to the previously computed point
		% Set the max strain/stress to be min strain/stress + 2*ey and +2*fy 
		% Set the current stress = the stress as if you're on branch 1
	% If you're on (branch 2) and (moving to the left)
		% Go to branch 3
		% Set the max strain/stress to the previously computed point
		% Set the min strain/stress to be the max strain/stress - 2*ey and -2*fy away
		% Set the current stress = the stress as if you're on branch 3
